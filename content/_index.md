## Welcome to Hacking the Cloud!

Hacking the cloud is a encyclopedia of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use on their next cloud exploitation adventure.

All content on this site is created by volunteers. If you'd like to be one of them, you can contribute your knowledge by submitting a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Hacking-the-Cloud/hackingthe.cloud/pulls). We are open to content from any major cloud provider and will also accept cloud-related technologies as well (Docker, Terraform, Oracle, etc.).
