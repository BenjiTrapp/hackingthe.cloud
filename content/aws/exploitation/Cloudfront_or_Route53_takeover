Utilizing various enumeration techniques for recon and enumeration and attacker can discover an orphaned Cloudfront distribution and/or a DNS Record that is attempting to serve content from an S3 bucket that no longer exists. There are numerous tools to do this, but I have been using Domainwatch combined with CTFR 

Essentially you need a list of domains to cycle through (enumerate via CTFR or amass or the like) then test each host to look for a specific error page that contains the text "NoSuchBucket"

```
<Error>
<Code>NoSuchBucket</Code>
<Message>The specified bucket does not exist</Message>
<BucketName>hackingthe.cloud</BucketName>
<RequestId>68M9C1KTARF9FBYN</RequestId>
<HostId>RpbdvVU9AXidVVI/1zD+WTwYdVI5YMqQNJShmf6zJlztBVyINq8TtqbzWpThdi/LivlOWRVCPVs=</HostId>
</Error>
```

The simple next step is to go create a bucket with this name in S3. 

This alone can be enough to stop the bucket from being taken over by anyone else. However, you may want to place some POC code in an index.html file to provide a POC

With just the account id of a target you can enumerate the names of IAM users and roles by abusing [Resource-Based Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_resource-based).


There are a few ways to do this, for example, Pacu's module will attempt to change the AssumeRole policy of a role in <ins>your</ins> account and specify a role in another account.

Another way would be to use S3 Bucket Policies. Take the following example:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Example permissions",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/role_name"
            },
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*bucket you own*"
        }
    ]
}
```

You would apply this policy to a bucket <ins>you</ins> own. By specifying a principal in the target account (123456789123), you can determine if that principals exists. If setting the bucket policy succeeds you know the role exists. If it fails you know the role does not.

{{< notice warning "Note" >}}
Doing either of these things will generate a lot of CloudTrail events, specifically UpdateAssumeRolePolicy or PutBucketPolicy in your account. If your intention is to be stealthy is is not advised (or required) to use a targets credentials. Instead you should use your own.

While this works for both IAM users and roles, this will also work with [service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html). This will allow you to enumerate various services the account uses, such as GuardDuty or Organizations.

To automate this process you can use the [Pacu Module](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu/tree/master/modules/iam__enum_roles) or [this](https://github.com/Frichetten/enumate_iam_using_bucket_policy) which will attempt to brute force it for you.

```
usage: main.py [-h] --id ID --my_bucket MY_BUCKET [--wordlist WORDLIST] (--role | --user)

Enumerate IAM/Users of an AWS account. You must provide your OWN AWS account and bucket

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --id ID               The account id of the target account
  --my_bucket MY_BUCKET
                        The bucket used for testing (belongs to you)
  --wordlist WORDLIST   Wordlist containers user/role names
  --role                Search for a IAM Role
  --user                Search for a IAM User
```
